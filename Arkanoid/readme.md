# Game Run
The player can control the craft by the mouse and try to position the craft so it bounces the ball to the right position to break all the bricks. The score can be shown on the bottom left side of the window and the ball shadows can be seen with a darker colour

# Game Over
When the player can’t hit the ball with the craft and the ball passes the craft and hits the bottom side of the window, the player loses. The ball disappears and a box appears on the centre of the screen stating the known “GAME OVER” statement followed by the player’s current score.
